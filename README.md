# FindYourNeighbour: An API Design Exercise

We are building a neighbourhood collaboration site and we want to make a system to keep track of people, houses, and addresses of those houses.

* Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
* Each house has an address and an owner
* Each address has a postcode and street address

## The REST API will need to enable users to:
* Store people, houses and addresses
* Look up a house, its address and owner
* Look up people in our neighbourhood within certain age brackets and with specific household sizes

## Database 
### Consider the type of data we will be storing and type of database we should implement (SQL vs NoSQL)
SQL, as we have strict requirements for data and there should be no null values/empty fields. 
### Create a schema for this database

### Consider the requests our API should be capable of handling

### List the routes you will need with their HTTP verb and path
### Determine the responses that should be returned and the content types of these requests and responses
### Create documentation for your API on a tool of your choice
